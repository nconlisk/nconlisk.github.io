***Current Position/Affiliation:*** Freelance

***Skills and Services:*** 

Programming | Numerical Simulation | Biomedical Engineering | Medical Image Analysis | Photogrammetry | Scientific Writing | Proofreading & Editing.

***About me:***

I hold a PhD in Orthopaedic Engineering from the University of Edinburgh UK, and a BEng (honours) degree in Mechanical Engineering (specialising in biomedical engineering) from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology Ireland.

Working at the interface between engineering and medicine, I employ problem solving and technical engineering skills to answer clinically relevant questions. While my work to date has spanned the fields of cardiovascular biomechanics, orthopaedic engineering and the role of 3D printing in visualisation/presurgical planning, I am constantly on the look out for new areas within which to apply my skills and knowledge.

I am currently improving my software and web development skills through independent study and online learning, with the goal of moving into a developer role. 


***Specialist Domain Specific Skills:***

* Finite element mesh generation from medical imaging data (CT/MRI).
* Patient specific modelling.
* Orthopaedic implant design.
* Design and manufacture of in vitro test apparatus.
* Musculoskeletal and Cardiovascular biomechanics.
* Scripting, and high performance computing.
* 3D model creation and visualisation in CAD.
* Advanced manufacturing processes (manual/CNC machining/3D printing).
