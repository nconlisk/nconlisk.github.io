                        <p>This project built upon the initial skills learned from the ToDo App project, with several
                            improvements to the UI, and added features such as API calls and accessing data from system
                            hardware.</p>
                        <p>Books can be added to the database in three different ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manually through the ADD NEW modal</li>
                            <li>Automatically by typing the book ISBN number into the IMPORT modal</li>
                            <li>Using system hardware (webcam) with the @zxing/browser library to scan book barcodes
                                directly</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On import, book title/author/publication year, and a thumbnail of the artwork are displayed
                            on the frontend, along side a progress bar indicating how much of the book has been read.

                        <p>This project employed modern libraries and approaches to create a simple check list
                            application, with user authentication, new task creation/updating/deleting. This project was
                            completed with guidance from a tutorial by <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYEkguL9PcY" target="_blank">Ania Kubow</a>, to
                            allow me to become familiar with modern approaches to web application development.</p>
                        <p>The tutorial was very in-depth, with a "build everything from the ground up" approach.
                            However, some topics not covered in this project include: test driven development, possible
                            app vulnerabilities and data security considerations. The tutorial code had to be modified
                            for deployment on Vercel instead of the cloud provider mentioned in the tutorial.</p>

                        <p>This project was a new implementation of the Secret Santa v1 app. It leveraged the PyQt
                            framework to create a much more clean user interface. Additional features implemented in
                            this new version were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Facility to load names and email addresses from a .csv file in addition to manual input
                            </li>
                            <li>Names displayed in the dialogue box below the buttons for verification purposes prior to
                                the draw</li>
                            <li>Results backed up to a text file once pairs were drawn</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The backend interfaces were handled in a similar manner to the v1 app, using Python with
                            smtplib and email.mime.multipart libraries, and automated emails sent through a dedicated
                            gmail account.</p>

                        <p>This project was developed in response to a disastrous Christmas gift exchange, where a late
                            signup to an online pairing website left one family member with no gift and another with too
                            many! To prevent this from reoccurring, I created a simple GUI based program that would:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collect usernames and email addresses</li>
                            <li>Draw gift exchange pairs</li>
                            <li>Automatically notify the paired recipients via email</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The GUI was built with tkinter, the backend handled with Python using smtplib and
                            email.mime.multipart libraries, and the automated emails sent through a dedicated gmail
                            account.</p>
